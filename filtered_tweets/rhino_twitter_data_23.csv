interestingly, though, we find comparatively few harmful mutations in the modern-day rhino genomes

we hypothesize that recent inbreeding may have enabled natural selection to remove such mutations, leaving the surviving species somewhat less vulnerable to genetic disease https://t.co/fa0ooxk4we",1430187056765050887,1182709305650417665,en,2021-08-24 15:15:40+00:00

however, even though limited genetic diversity appears to be a long-term feature in rhinos, we find that modern rhinos have lower heterozygosity and higher inbreeding compared to ancient/historical ones.

a comparison with genomes from other animals shows that rhinos have low heterozygosity. 

this suggests that low genetic diversity and moderate inbreeding are intrinsic features of rhino life history, possibly due to their low population densities and limited dispersal. https://t.co/rsri2puecd",1430184370871181317,1182709305650417665,en,2021-08-24 15:05:00+00:00

investigating a question that goes back to the time of darwin, we show that the main division among rhinos is between african and eurasian rhinos, rather than between rhinos that have one versus two horns.
